Last month, our awesome General Manager, Ulysses, had the opportunity to speak at the CompTIA conference about how SSW is creating AI agents like YakShaver. The talk focused on how we’ve used AI to simplify task delegation and issue reporting, making it more accessible and efficient for everyone on the team, from designers to developers. One of SSW's lead designers, who wasn’t initially familiar with AI or its capabilities, was especially impressed by the "one and done" nature of AI tools like YakShaver.At SSW, YakShaver has become an essential tool...

We often have several Sprints running simultaneously across different projects and teams, with only a few senior managers overseeing them. YakShaver automatically routes tasks to the right people, cutting down on the back-and-forth during Sprints, which everyone appreciates. What made Uly’s talk stand out was showing that AI doesn’t have to be complicated—it can work quietly in the background, improving workflows without requiring technical expertise from users.Uly shared real examples from our team, highlighting how AI has streamlined our processes without adding complexity. The response at CompTIA was positive, with many attendees eager to learn how they could adopt similar approaches in their own projects.

For us, it was a great opportunity to show how AI can be practical and useful, making every day work easier without being overwhelming. YakShaver is just one way we’re achieving that, and it was exciting to share our experience with a wider audience.
