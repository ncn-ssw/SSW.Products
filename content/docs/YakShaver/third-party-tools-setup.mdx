While [Microsoft Teams](recording-work-item-teams) and the [browser extension](recording-work-item-browser-extension) are the recommended ways to get started with YakShaver, we also support a variety of third-party recording tools. These tools offer additional flexibility and features like keyboard shortcuts for power users who want to optimize their workflow.

## How It Works

When configured correctly, YakShaver monitors specific folders in your OneDrive for new recordings. When it finds a new recording, it automatically processes it into a work item.

## Setup with Snagit

[Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is a popular screen recording tool that works seamlessly with YakShaver. For detailed usage instructions after setup, see our [Recording with Snagit Guide](recording-work-item-snagit).

### Initial Setup

1. Open Snagit Editor
2. Go to **Edit | Editor Preferences**
3. Open the **Library** tab
4. Change the library location to your OneDrive Recordings folder:\
   `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
5. Click **OK** (you'll be prompted to restart Snagit)

### Configuring Keyboard Shortcuts

To become a power user, set up keyboard shortcuts for quick recording:

1. In Snagit, ensure that "All-in-one" is selected
2. Set your "Capture" hotkey (we recommend using "Print Screen")

### Important YakShaver Configuration

1. Open YakShaver in Microsoft Teams
2. Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot\
   (This prevents processing of old videos during setup)
3. After configuring Snagit, type **ON** in YakShaver to reactivate processing

### Quick Start Recording

1. Press your configured hotkey (e.g., "Print Screen")
2. Select the video recording option
3. Record your screen while explaining the task
4. Stop the recording when finished
5. YakShaver will automatically process the recording

## Windows Snipping Tool

The built-in Windows Snipping Tool can also be configured to work with YakShaver. For detailed usage instructions after setup, see our [Windows Snipping Tool Guide](recording-work-item-snipping-tool).

1. Open Windows Settings > System > Storage
2. Under "Save locations", set Videos to your OneDrive folder:\
   `OneDrive/Recordings/SnippingTool/`
3. Open Snipping Tool settings and ensure recordings save to this location

## Mac Screenshot App

The built-in Mac Screenshot App provides an easy way for MacOS users to create work items. For detailed usage instructions after setup, see our [Mac Screenshot App Guide](recording-work-item-screenshot-app).

### Initial Setup

1. Create the recordings folder:\
   `OneDrive/Recordings/ScreenshotApp/`
2. Configure Screenshot App to save to this location
3. Enable microphone access

## Other Recording Tools

You can use almost any recording tool with YakShaver if it can save to a specific folder. Just configure your tool to save recordings to:

`OneDrive/Recordings/[ToolName]/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Wrong file format?**\
  Ensure your recording tool is saving in .mp4 or .mov format
* **Files saved to wrong location?**\
  Double-check the save location in your recording tool's settings
